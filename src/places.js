Irrespective of how much you read about the Grand Canyon, you’re sure to end up being spellbound, for nothing prepares you for the magical sight that this wonder has to offer.

The canyon is divided into three rims, North, West and South, and all three offer incredibly unique experiences. The South Rim is the most visited feature of the Canyon for it hosts a majority of the region's infrastructure, Native American ruins, viewpoints and historic artifacts. However, if you’re after adventure and solitude, the North Rim is where you need to be.",

        description: "1,000 years ago, in 1023, work began building this astonishing Gothic-style Benedictine abbey, known throughout the medieval world as the ‘Wonder of the West’. It’s easy to see why. Teetering on top of a rocky outcrop, half a mile out to sea in the middle of the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel, it looks like something dreamt up in a fairytale. Located on the border of Normandy and Brittany, the bay is home to Europe’s largest tidal range, reaching close to 50 feet in spring. At low tide, it’s possible to walk barefoot to the abbey crossing the vast sandflats that surround it. At high tide, it appears to float on the sea like an ocean mirage.",

It presents a fantasy-like landscape that looks like it’s been plucked out of a fairy tale, with alien-like hills and boulders that seem as if they’ve been transported from another planet. The humans who once lived here used the area’s soft stone to create underground shelters, leaving all kinds of weird architectural wonders in their wake. The lunar landscape is stunning on its own, but the countless hot-air balloons that fill up the sky with shades of red, yellow, orange and cream simply take its beauty to the next level. The Goreme Open Air Museum and its rock-cut churches and the subterranean wonders of Kaymakli are among the best things to see in Cappadocia.",
